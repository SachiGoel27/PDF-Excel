# PDF–Excel Automation Suite  

### Data Management Automation Projects for Equipment Reuse International (ERI)  

During my internship with **Equipment Reuse International (ERI)**, I led two large-scale data automation initiatives that transformed the company’s inventory and parts data workflows. These systems automated manual processes that previously took hours—reducing them to minutes—while increasing data accuracy and scalability.

---

## Overview  

This repository contains the automation systems developed for:

1. **Inventory Migration to Sortly** — Automated data transformation and migration from Excel to the Sortly inventory management platform with API integration.  
2. **Parts Manual Digitization System** — Automated extraction and normalization of data from complex manufacturer PDF manuals (Liebherr, Sennebogen, etc.) into structured Excel outputs.

Together, these projects demonstrate end-to-end data automation across file formats, APIs, and web platforms—using over **1,500 lines of Python code** across multiple modules.

## Project 1 — Sortly Inventory Migration System  

### Problem  
ERI’s inventory was maintained in Excel spreadsheets, creating slow, error-prone manual updates and no real-time tracking.  

### Technical Solution  
- **Python Engine (835 lines)** handling:
  - Complex data transformation and location parsing  
  - Quantity distribution across multi-location items  
  - Vendor data integration and automated state processing  
  - Comprehensive error handling and quality control  
- **Sortly API Integration**
  - Intelligent rate limiting with local caching (↓ API calls by 60%)  
  - Automatic error recovery and state synchronization  
- **Streamlit Web Interface**
  - User-friendly front-end for non-technical staff  
  - Real-time progress tracking, error reporting, and execution logs  

### Impact  
- Migrated **40,000+ inventory items in <20 minutes**  
- Reduced manual processing time from **hours to minutes**  
- Achieved **99% migration accuracy**

## Project 2 — Parts Manual Digitization System  

### Problem  
ERI receives large manufacturer PDF manuals (1,000+ pages) with thousands of parts. Manual data entry took **8–12 hours per manual** and produced inconsistent, error-prone outputs.

### Technical Solutions  

#### Multi-Manufacturer PDF Engine  
- **Liebherr Integration (`liebherr.py`, 120+ lines)**  
  - Advanced table extraction via `pdfplumber`  
  - Automatic order number and quantity detection  
  - Regex parsing and Excel formatting with professional styling  

- **Sennebogen Integration (`sennebogen.py`, 400+ lines)**  
  - Three PDF vertical-line detection algorithms:
    1. Header-based text analysis  
    2. Rectangle boundary detection  
    3. Line-based geometric analysis  
  - Intelligent column boundary detection  
  - Header normalization across formats  
  - Table reconstruction with merged-cell and overflow handling  

#### Web Scraping & Vendor Integration (`senn_web.py`, 120+ lines)
- Secure vendor portal authentication  
- Real-time lookup for part specs, pricing, and stock  
- Automated shopping-cart ordering  

#### Purchase Order Processing (`qbo.py`, 200+ lines)
- Automated PDF invoice extraction  
- Fillable form generation for receiving departments  
- HTML/CSS template system for standardized formatting

### Key Technical Features  
- **Multi-format compatibility:** Handles 5+ manufacturer layouts  
- **Intelligent error recovery:** Automatic fallback algorithms  
- **Data validation:** Cross-checks with vendor databases  
- **Batch processing:** Simultaneous multi-manual handling  
- **Flexible export:** Excel, CSV, and PDF

## Results & Impact  

These automation systems revolutionized ERI’s data workflow by combining robust backend processing with accessible user interfaces.

**Summary:**
- 40+ hours/week saved in manual processing  
- <2% error rate across all systems  
- 10× scalability capacity  
- $30,000+ annual cost savings  

These results demonstrate expertise in **data engineering, API integration, automation design, and UI/UX development** — all applied to solve high-impact real-world problems.
